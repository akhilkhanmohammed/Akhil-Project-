In this project i have implemented modules and libraries which support this project assignment 

- Pandas :

  Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, SQL, Microsoft Excel. Pandas allows various data manipulation operations such as merging, reshaping, selecting, as well as data cleaning, and data wrangling features.

- xlwings : 

 xlwings offers an easy way to expose an Excel workbook via REST API both on Windows and macOS. This can be useful when you have a workbook running on a single computer and want to access it from another computer. Or you can build a Linux based web app that can interact with a legacy Excel application while you are in the progress of migrating the Excel functionality into your web app

- flask :

 Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications.
